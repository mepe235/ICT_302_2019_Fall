What Is Being Done?
> The work that I am committing to doing for our CMS Guidebook will be Chapter 7 which will provide information on other CMS's. Specifically, I will be providing detailed information on eCommerce (examples such as Amazon and Ebay) as well as multichannel distribution of content.
> I plan to include examples of other CMS's such as Drupal and Joomla and detail their positive/negative qualities briefly.

When Is It Being Done?
> My rough timeline as of now is to have three subsections of Chapter 7: ECommerce, MultiChannel Distribution, and Other CMS's. I plan to have the ECommerce commitment finished no later than November 3rd, the MultiChannel Distribution commitment completed by November 10th, and Other CMS's commitment finished by December 6th. 
> With this proactive timeline, I will allow myself an adequate amount of time to accomplish my work, as well as assist anyone else who may need help with research or writing.

How Will It Be Evaluated?
> My evaluator will base my eight point grade on the quality and accuracy of my writing, the quantity of research provided, and the timeliness of my commitments. 
> My grade should also be dependent on how descriptive my content is and if an adequare amount of examples are provided.

Who Will Evaluate It?
> Ashley McCann will be evaluating my work throughout the semester. As a fellow editor, she understands the standards set to achieve the most successful work.
